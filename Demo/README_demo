##################################################

# The goal of this demo is to familiarize the user with HotSpot3D.
# There are two main parts to HotSpot3D, preprocessing and analysis.
# There are many options not highlighted here, because I want to show how HotSpot3D can be run with defaults.
# I have included somatic mutations from SMAD2, SMAD3, and SMAD4 derived from TCGA.
# The included .maf file is really a subset of a full .maf file.
# This is because the columns in the demo.maf are the minimum necessary columns needed to work with HotSpot3D.
# For each step I have included standard out (1) and error (2) print outs, but these are optional.
# In total, this demo can be run within an hour for most systems with LSF server capability.
# Without the LSF server, you may try working with mutations from just one gene (grep SMAD2 demo.maf > small.demo.maf).
# In addition without the LSF server, you will need to run calpro instead of uppro (see below).
# Not included in preprocessing is the drugport step, but this can be run separately in the preprocessing stage.
# Not included in analysis is the sigclus step due to very lengthy runtime.
# HotSpot3D sigclus is under active development and should be efficient and available soon.
# For each step, specific help information can be found by entering, 'hotspot3d <command>'.

## BEFORE RUNNING
mkdir -p prep/cosmic pdb
# The pdb directory can hold .pdb files, but downloading them is not necessary for HotSpot3D.
# When necessary, HotSpot3D will retrieve structures from RCSB.org without downloading them to your disk.

# See the HotSpot3D README.md for details on the COSMIC download.
# Put COSMIC annotation download into prep/cosmic/
# Make sure COSMIC download has 6 columns:
#1	gene_name
#2	transcript_name
#3	trv_type
#4	amino_acid_change
#5	domain
#6	tissue_type

## RUNNING PREPROCESSING
hotspot3d uppro --output-dir prep/ --pdb pdb/ --gene-file demo.maf --3d-distance-cutoff 20 1>demo.uppro.out 2>demo.uppro.err

# The uppro step launches jobs to an LSF server, and those jobs run calpro.
# If you do not have an LSF server, you can skip uppro, and run calpro 'manually'.
# To get help with calpro, simply enter the command, 'hotspot3d calpro'.

# Before running any additional steps, make sure that the uppro/calpro runs are finished.
